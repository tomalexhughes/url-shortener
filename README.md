# URL Shortener

This repository contains code for a URL shortener as part of an interview task.

## Authentication

To prevent implementing full OAuth authentication, API requests are verified with a 'Generic Access Token' that can be generated by logging in to [Bitly](https://app.bitly.com/settings/api/).

## Browser Support

This application makes use of some of the latest ESNext features, as it stands currently not all polyfills have been used and therefore support is not guaranteed outside of the 'evergreen' browsers.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required by the project:

* REACT_APP_BITLY_URL (https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/)
* REACT_APP_BITLY_GENERIC_TOKEN

## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Create a `.env` file - using `.env.example` as a template, and provide your API access token.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the application in development mode.
4. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

NOTE: This app has been tested with Node.js 18. This is the LTS at the time of writing. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node versions.
